# AlgoTrader

## Overview
This Python project simulates a simplified stock market where stock prices evolve randomly but with a degree of predictability. It includes a trading bot that attempts to make trading decisions based on market conditions simulated by the program.

## Features
- **Stock Market Simulation:** Generates random stock price movements with predictable trends.
- **Trading Bot:** Implements a basic trading algorithm to buy and sell stocks based on simulated market data.
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Collects and analyzes historical price data to inform trading decisions.
- **User Interface:** Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the simulation and trading bot.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lieuanthony/AlgoTrader
```

## Usage
**1. Running the Simulation**

```bash
python market.py
```

This command starts the stock market simulation and initializes the trading bot.

**2. Interacting with the Trading Bot:**
  - The trading bot automatically makes buy and sell decisions based on simulated market conditions.
  - Adjust the trading algorithm in trader.py to modify trading strategies.
**3. Analyzing Results:**
  - Review console output for simulated market trends and trading bot decisions.
  - Modify simulation parameters in market.py to adjust market behavior.
